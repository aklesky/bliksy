# Motivation

I recently switched from [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and finally decided to work with GitHub and ***open source***.
Switching to ***Vite*** and working on **open-source** projects on **GitHub** is a practical decision that can improve my workflow and growth.
My monorepo is the perfect place to showcase and share my custom front-end configurations with everyone.

I prefer to work with [React](https://reactjs.org/), my main front-end library, to create UI, Components, and Web, so in monorepo, mostly all packages are related to working with React Library and Don't Repeat My Self with everyday tasks.
